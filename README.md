## Introduction

This Investment Recovery Path Calculator is a Python-based tool that analyzes cryptocurrency investment portfolios from Excel files and calculates optimal recovery strategies for assets with negative returns. The script performs proportional allocation of available budget based on current losses to minimize overall portfolio loss percentage.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic Excel data loading and preprocessing with data cleaning
- Proportional loss-based budget allocation across losing assets
- New loss percentage calculation after hypothetical investment
- Improvement metrics showing expected recovery in percentage points
- Comprehensive output table with investment recommendations
- Detailed logging with timestamps for execution history

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.7
- pandas >= 2.0.0
- numpy >= 1.24.0
- openpyxl >= 3.1.0 (for Excel file reading)
- colorama == 0.4.6 (for terminal coloring)
- Excel file with proper format containing columns: Data, Total Spent - R$, Current Amount - R$, Profit - R$, Profit - %

## Setup

### Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrenoFariasdaSilva/Investiment-Recovery-Path.git
   cd Investiment-Recovery-Path
   ```

### Python, Pip and Venv

In order to run the scripts, you must have python3, pip and venv installed in your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can use the following commands to install it:

#### Linux

In order to install python3, pip and venv in Linux, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
```

#### MacOS

In order to install python3 and pip in MacOS, you can use the following commands:

```bash
brew install python3
```

#### Windows

In order to install python3 and pip in Windows, you can use the following commands in case you have `choco` installed:

```bash
choco install python3
```

Or just download the installer from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Great, you now have python3 and pip installed. Now, we need to install the additional project requirements. 

## Run Python Code:

```bash
# Run directly with Python:
python3 main.py # Mac and Linux users can use python3
python main.py # Windows users can use python

# Or using Makefile:
make run
```

### Dependencies

1. Install the project dependencies with the following command:

   ```bash
   # Using Makefile:
   make dependencies
   
   # Or manually with pip:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the script**: Edit the configuration constants in `main.py`:
   - `INPUT_FILE`: Path to your Excel file (default: "./Input/Invested Money.xlsx")
   - `SHEET_NAME`: Name of the Excel sheet to read (default: "CryptoCurrencies")
   - `AVAILABLE_BUDGET`: Available budget for investment recovery in R$ (default: 500.00)
   - `EXCLUDED_CRYPTOS`: List of cryptocurrencies to exclude from calculation (default: ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "USDC", "USDT", "Ripple"])
   - `EXCLUDE_POSITIVE_CRYPTOCURRENCIES`: Set to True to exclude cryptocurrencies with positive profit (default: True)

2. **Prepare your Excel file**: Ensure your Excel file has the following columns:
   - Data (CryptoCurrency names)
   - Total Spent - R$
   - Current Amount - R$
   - Profit - R$
   - Profit - %

3. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   make run
   # or
   python main.py
   ```

4. **View results**: Check the terminal output for investment recommendations and review `Logs/main.log` for detailed execution history.

## Results

The script generates comprehensive investment recovery recommendations including:

- **Filtered Portfolio Analysis**: Identifies all cryptocurrencies with losses (excluding specified coins)
- **Proportional Budget Allocation**: Distributes the available budget proportionally based on loss magnitudes
- **Recovery Projections**: Calculates new loss percentages after hypothetical investment
- **Improvement Metrics**: Shows expected improvement in percentage points for each asset
- **Summary Table**: Displays CryptoCurrency name, current loss (R$), recommended investment amount, old % loss, new % loss, and improvement percentage
- **Total Calculations**: Provides total current losses and total investment allocation
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed logs saved to `Logs/main.log` with timestamps for audit and debugging purposes

Generated output files
- **Excel**: `Output/main_Results.xlsx`
  - Sheet contains columns (left-to-right): `#`, `CryptoCurrency`, `Current Loss (R$)`, `Investment`, `Old % Loss`, `New % Loss`, `Improvement %`.
  - The leading `#` column is a 1-based index (starts at 1).
  - Empty/NA cells are written as a dash (`-`) in the spreadsheet (for clarity on totals or missing percentages).

- **CSV**: `Output/main_Results.csv`
  - CSV containing header (left-to-right): `#`, `CryptoCurrency`, `Current Loss (R$)`, `Investment`, `Old % Loss`, `New % Loss`, `Improvement %`.
  - Standard CSV format: comma (`,`) delimiter, dot (`.`) decimal separator.
  - Encoded as UTF-8 with BOM to improve compatibility with Excel on Windows.
  - Floats are formatted with two decimal places (e.g. `-1295.39`).
  - The first column is `#` (index starting at 1) and the subsequent columns match the Excel sheet.

  Example CSV (excerpt):

  ```csv
  #,CryptoCurrency,Current Loss (R$),Investment,Old % Loss,New % Loss,Improvement %
  1,BTC,-1295.39,250.00,-12.95,-10.52,2.43
  2,XRP,-502.10,250.00,-25.10,-20.00,5.10
  3,TOTAL,-1797.49,500.00,-,-,-
  ```
Notes about table contents
- The table includes a final `TOTAL` row where `CryptoCurrency` is `TOTAL` and numeric totals appear under `Current Loss (R$)` and `Investment`; percentage columns for the total are represented with a dash (`-`).

All monetary values are displayed in Brazilian Real (R$) with proper formatting, and the output is color-coded for easy reading in the terminal.
